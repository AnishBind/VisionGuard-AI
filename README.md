# VisionGuard AI

# 🛡️ Real-Time Edge AI Surveillance Analytics System

VisionGuard AI is a full-stack AI-powered surveillance analytics platform designed for smart workplace monitoring, CCTV intelligence, and real-time safety analytics.

The system combines **Computer Vision**, **YOLOv8**, **MediaPipe Pose**, and **Flask** to monitor human activity, detect abnormal events, and generate real-time alerts from webcam or CCTV footage.

Inspired by enterprise Edge AI systems used in warehouses, logistics centers, factories, and smart monitoring environments, VisionGuard AI demonstrates how lightweight AI inference can power intelligent surveillance applications.
